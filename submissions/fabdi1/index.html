		 <h2>Quick Recap of Last Season</h2>
		 <p> Arsenal finished second place in the league last season, behind the surprising Cinderella story of eventual champs Leicester City. lead by the Italian gaffer Claudio Ranieri, the Foxes stunned the footballing world (and the bookies, under 5000 to 1 odds), capturing the Premiere League title
		     usurping the usual title contenders Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea, and Arsenal. Manchester United under new manager Louis Van Gaal, struggled all season eventually missing out on a Champions League spot for the new season. Chelsea also lagged behind last season with the stunning
		     sacking of their living legend manager, Jose Mourinho. Manchester City played well all season but never managed to keep pace with Leicester City, who always scrapped up wins all season. Arsenal season started the season off slow with a suprising home loss to West Ham, 2-0, followed by a 0-0 draw with liverpool. Early into the season Arsenal where topsy turvy in form, knocking of League leaders Leicester City one week then suffering shock
		     defeats to minnows such as Sheffield Wednesday in the League Cup. Midway through the season Arsenal struggled to score for three straight games, dropping several points to league leaders Leicester. By March it was mathematically impossible for Arsenal to take the leagues top spot with an insermountable 12 point gap.
		</p>
                <p>    Arsenal's still had a great chance to defend there FA Cup for a third successive season, starting off strong with a win against Sunderland. Next up was Hull City in the fifth round. The game ended in a nil, nil draw forcing another leg, Arsenal pulling of the victory. Sadly the cup run came to a sudden end, a poor showing against Watford, ending
		      with a 2-1 loss. There Champions League foray also began on a shaky foot suffering surprising losses to Greek side Olympiacos F.C. and Dinamo Zagreb of Croatia. This left Arsenal with two tough back to back games with German giants Bayern Munich. Suprisingly Arsenal managed a beautiful 2-0 at home. The Match in Bavaria brought Arsenal
 		     crashing back to earth, with Bayern thrashing Arsenal 5-1. Arsenal managed to  finish second in there group behind Bayern with a final win on the last match day against Olympiacos. Sadly this left them matched up with Barcelona FC lead by the mecurial Lionel Messi in the round of 16. Long story short Arsenal took decisive loses during both legs,
		     ending there European dream.

		 <h2> New Look, New season!</h2>
		 <p> This is now the third season under new kit supplier Puma who took over for American brand Nike. Unlike traditional pro sports State side, football has partake in the ultimate money grab, releasing new variations of home and away jerseys for each successive season. Personally I have yet to grow an affinity for the duds Puma have been providing Arsenal, and sadly that remains the case. The home kit still holds on to the vintage look of Arsenal with the traditional colors of red and white. Down the
		     center of the jersey is a darker vertical red line for what I guess are strictly aesthetic reasons. The away kit returns with the usual trend of yellow, this time, accompanied by the contrasting grey. The away kit gets two thumbs down from me with its weird collar and the grey instead of the usual preferred
	             blue. The third alternate kit is a pretty dull primarily dark blue look with yellow strips down the side which gets the ultimate meh from me. My main gripe with pumas jerseys though still remains the skin tight fitting of the kit, hugging the body way to tight. How do they play in those things I ask.

		<h2> Summer Transfer Window </h2>
		<p> Arsenal transfer window foray season in and out, is exiting for all the wrong reasons. Endless links to signings of world class players that never materializes is something all Gunner fans have grown accustomed to. The transfer policy of Arsenal headed by manager Arsene Wenger, and how it unfolds plays out the same every year. You get excited for whats to come with all the ramblings of business to be done but alas, the outcome never changes. While all the big clubs make record breaking signings to
	             upgrade there squads, Arsenal never fails to disappoint in disappointing there fans. The big talking points coming into the season was Arsenal's need for a proven goal scorer to frontline the squad. Last year was the Karim Benzema Saga, the Real Madrid star who was constantly linked to arrive at the Emirates which guess what, never happened. This years version included the Argentine Gonzalo Higuain who eventually stayed in Italy leaving Napoli to join Italian giants Juventus and James Vardy
		     who remained with his squad. His fellow squad mate Riyad Mahrez was linked with Arsenal for quite some time, his saga ending with his stay at Leicester, with a fatter contract to keep him satisfied.
		    Next in line in the rumor mill was Alexandre Lacazette who still remains with his French club Olympique Lyonnais. Arsenal suffered key injuries on the defensive side with injuries to two key defenders that led to calls of defensive reinforcements. Of course links eventually began to be made to various players around Europe most notably Mustafi of Valencia but not surprisingly nothing has materialized. Arsenals main signing which most due agree was good
		    business was the arrival of Swiss defensive midfielder Granit Xhaka from German outfit Borussia Monchengladbach for around 30 million Euros. Arsenal did do a little bit more business signing defender Rob Holding from Bolton who most likely will be cover until key defenders get off the injured list. Two other signings made by Arsenal are the usual young players for the "future," as Arsene likes to say including Japanese forward Takuma Asano and Nigerian
		    Kelechi Nwakali whom must likely will have little to no impact on the upcoming Season. Departures for the Season include Joel Campbell, Matthieu Flamini, Mikel Arteta, and fan favorite Tomas Rosicky. The transfer window closes on the last day of August so more changes could be made.

	       <h2> Looking into the Crystal Ball</h2>
	       <p> Expectations for Arsenal for this season or as usual hopeful but with great apprehension. Arsenal still maintain a strong squad but the top teams have improved to a much greater degree. Manchester United acquired two key playmakers, the mega signing of Paul Pogba, returning to his old stomping grounds, and also the beast Zlatan Ibrahimovic. They look to be much better side under Mourinho after Van Gaal disastrous run. Chelsea as usual splashed
		   cash left and right bringing in Kante from league champions Leicester City plus Belgium ace Michy Batshuayi. Under the guidance of experienced manager Conte, Chelsea are primed for a great season. The premiere league has also become home to two other top class managers, Pep Guardiola at Man City and Jurgen Klop at the Kop. Both have excellent squads who will be eager to prove there worth to there new bosses.
		   I think Leicester will be hard pressed to recreate there magic from last year, but a top 6 position could more than likely be possible after holding on to Vardy and Mahrez both staying put after considerable interest from Arsenal. Cross town rivals Spuds managed a third place finish last year after a great run guaranteeing Champions League football. Pottechino has Spuds poised for another possible great run this year. Arsenal cant afford another slow start to the season
		   if the hope to stay in the title race. It is imperative for them to stay with the pack as the quality hasn't improved much. The injuries have to keep at bay plus big players such as Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez must stay in form. Key signings may still happen, but I believe Wenger will prove the doubters wrong and finally steer Arsenal to the promise land. My top four and bottom four for the year:
